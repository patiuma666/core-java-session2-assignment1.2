Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter

*Compiler is a translator.
*It converts the source code (source program) to object code(object program).
*It coverts high level language to machine level language.
*Compiler is a source code that checks all errors found in a program.
*The compiler takes your .javafile and compiles it into a .classfile

* An interpreter is a program that reads in as input a source program
*And it  is a line by line execution of a program
*The jvm takes your .classfile and interuptes it.
*After compiling a program while execution it checks the errors in a byte code.
